# NLP Translation - Recurrent Neural Network

### Introduction
In this notebook, we will build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. Our completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.

### Install
This notebook requires **Python 3**.  
Dependencies found in `requirements.txt`.

### Getting Started
Run `jupyter notebook machine_translation.ipynb` in this directory.
